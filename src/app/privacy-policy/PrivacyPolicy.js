We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.</li>
                                    <li className="my-2"><strong>Through your use of the App:</strong> When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers, and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</li>
                                    <li className="my-2"><strong>Using cookies:</strong> Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.
