                                <p>It is a mandatory requirement for most of the countries; foreign nationals coming into the country must hold a passport with a validity of a minimum of 06 months. Visa and health regulations are different from country to country. It is the sole responsibility of an individual traveller to ensure the submission of complete documentation and medical requirements to the country embassy/consulate they are visiting. Travanya takes no responsibility for any rejections or declines of the visa issuance due to any reasons.</p>
